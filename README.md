# PUZZLE-GAME 
"In the puzzle game, the images are initially shown for a very short period of time (2 seconds) and then hidden. In this game, the user has to choose an image and match it with a similar one. The game environment is a 4x4 grid where there are a total of 8 distinct images, and the position of the images changes randomly each time. If the user is able to match the images correctly, their score will be updated by 100, and the number of steps will increase with each right or wrong selection of images. This game tests the user's soft skills such as eyesight and memory, helping them to find the correct position of the image. It is a memory testing game.  This puzzle game is not only fun and challenging, but it also helps to improve the user's cognitive abilities. By repeatedly playing this game, the user can train their brain to better remember visual cues and develop their problem-solving skills."
